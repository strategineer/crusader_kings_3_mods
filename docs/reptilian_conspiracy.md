# Reptilian Conspiracy Kings
Reptilian Conspiracy Kings is a Crusaders Kings III mod where the player's ruler is said the first reptilian being on the Earth. You must convert as many humans into Reptilians and create a new Reptilian world order.
## Specifications
- Reptilians must have an Reptilian trait (secret?) which provides the following bonuses:
    - People with the Reptilian trait gain a relationship bonus for other people with the Reptilian trait and a minor relationship penalty to people without the Reptilian trait.
    - When a person with the Reptilian trait lies with a person without the Reptilian trait, the person without the Reptilian trait gains the Reptilian trait.
    - Any children sired by at least one person with the Reptilian trait, are born with the Reptilian trait.
    - A person with the Reptilian trait may start a difficult scheme to add the Reptilian trait to a person without the trait. This scheme is made much easier based on the relationship of the target to the Player.
    - If a person with the Reptilian trait makes a new Reptilian, through any means, they have a chance of getting an increase to each of their stats.
- Through a decision, the player character can decide to make their ruler a Reptilian.
- Progression?
- Events?
- ? figure out if we can use the election system to create a "new world order extra goverment"

## Bugs
- Having "relations" doesn't transmit the Reptilian trait like it should (having kids does give it to them though!)
