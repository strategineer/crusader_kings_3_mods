# Reptilian Conspiracy Kings
Reptilian Conspiracy Kings is a Crusaders Kings III mod where the player's ruler is said Alien from Outer Space. You must convert as many humans into Aliens and reveal yourselves to the world by founding the Alienian religion.
## Specifications
- Aliens must have an Alien trait (secret?) which provides the following bonuses:
    - People with the Alien trait gain a relationship bonus for other people with the Alien trait and a minor relationship penalty to people without the Alien trait.
    - When a person with the Alien trait lies with a person without the Alien trait, the person without the Alien trait gains the Alien trait.
    - Any children sired by at least one person with the Alien trait, are born with the Alien trait.
    - A person with the Alien trait may start a difficult scheme to add the Alien trait to a person without the trait. This scheme is made much easier based on the relationship of the target to the Player.
    - If a person with the Alien trait makes a new Alien, through any means, they have a chance of getting an increase to each of their stats.
- Implement a new Alienian religion
- Through a decision, the player character can decide to convert to the Alienian religion, the cost is lower depending on how many aliens have been created.
