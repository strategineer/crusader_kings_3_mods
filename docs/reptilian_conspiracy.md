# Reptilian Conspiracy Kings
Reptilian Conspiracy Kings is a Crusaders Kings III mod where the player's ruler is said the first reptilian being on the Earth. You must convert as many humans into Reptilians and create a new Reptilian world order.

    - Any children sired by at least one person with the Reptilian trait, are born with the Reptilian trait.
    - A person with the Reptilian trait may start a difficult scheme to add the Reptilian trait to a person without the trait.
    - If a person with the Reptilian trait makes a new Reptilian, through any means, they should be reward for it in someway

## Bugs
- Turn Reptilian Scheme is copied from the Abduct scheme and lacks its own flavor (also I need to account for the special case where the target is in my prison or in another prison, I should probably disable turning a person in another prison into a reptilian)
- Turn Reptilian Scheme is way too hard and takes way too long (probably because I based it on the abduct scheme?, check with different intrigue stats and councilors? although the councilor shouldn't have an impact unless they are a reptilian)
    - It's easier now but I don't understand how the variables relate to the difficulty, need to investigate
- also, the scheme doesn't do anything once it's at 100%..
