# Reptilian Conspiracy Kings
Reptilian Conspiracy Kings is a Crusaders Kings III mod where the player's ruler is said the first reptilian being on the Earth. You must convert as many humans into Reptilians and create a new Reptilian world order.
## Specifications
- Reptilians must have an Reptilian trait (secret?) which provides the following bonuses:
    - People with the Reptilian trait gain a relationship bonus for other people with the Reptilian trait and a minor relationship penalty to people without the Reptilian trait.
    - Any children sired by at least one person with the Reptilian trait, are born with the Reptilian trait.
    - A person with the Reptilian trait may start a difficult scheme to add the Reptilian trait to a person without the trait.
    - If a person with the Reptilian trait makes a new Reptilian, through any means, they should be reward for it in someway
- Through a decision, the player character can decide to make their ruler a Reptilian.
- Progression?
- Events?
- ? figure out if we can use the election system to create a "new world order extra goverment"

## Bugs
- Turn Reptilian Scheme is copied from the Abduct scheme and lacks its own flavor (also I need to account for the special case where the target is in my prison or in another prison, I should probably disable turning a person in another prison into a reptilian)
- Turn Reptilian Scheme is way too hard and takes way too long (probably because I based it on the abduct scheme?, check with different intrigue stats and councilors? although the councilor shouldn't have an impact unless they are a reptilian)
